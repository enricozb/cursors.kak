# kak-cursors - todo

## features
- add keybinging to force *N instead of default `<c-d>` behavior.
  - this is for selecting single characters that don't have
    whitespace around them, like selecting `=` in code like this
    ```
    a=1
    b=2
    c=3
    ```
    easily doable with `<c-e>` -> `*N`, but is this the best way?

## readme
- add recording of usage
